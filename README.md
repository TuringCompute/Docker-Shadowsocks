# Docker Shadowsocks
This repo is intended to create a docker image that can run Shadowsocks implementation from https://shadowsocks.org/

To achieve this we will need to provide a set of data in JSON format and have it stored in config.json

with CompileCmd.py to compile the final command and parameters inside runCmd.sh and the entry point will be runCmd.sh

TODO:
- Run as Shadowsocks Server
- Run as Shadowsocks Client
